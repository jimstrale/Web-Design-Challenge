  <p> The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather cahnges as you get close to the equator. To accomplish this analysis,
    we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
  </p>
  <p> After asseblined the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs latiutude. Factors we looked at include:
    tempurature, ,cloudiness, windspeed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis,
    as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
